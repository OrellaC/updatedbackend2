<h1> Description: </h1>

<p> This is the backend portion of my <a href="https://github.com/OrellaC/E-Commerce-Project.git">e-commerce project </a>. This repository contains two CRUD applications. The first one is the wishlist application. This application allows users to suggest items they would like to be featured on the e-commerce site. Users are able to submit new item suggestions, access, edit, and delete previous entries. The second CRUD application is the help center application. It is similar to the wishlist application except it's purpose is to allow users to submit any issues they have ecnountered using the site or with their orders direclty to the company. Prior to creating this respository, I was using the <a href="https://github.com/OrellaC/e-comm-backend.git"> e-comm-backend repositroty </a>. However, I had to change my folder structure in order to deploy my backend to <a href="https://ecommbackend2022.herokuapp.com/"> Heroku</a>. </p>
